# Huffman-Encoding
Needs editing, The program can currently only read a file and output data concerning the HuffmanTree and Compression Data. 

Things to be done: the program does not have the ability to read the compressed data into a file, this is just a matter of matching the characters of the to-be-compressed file and matching them to the new binary encoding to be read into a file.
